CRITICAL: Each product is UNIQUE with its own DIFFERENTIATING characteristics. Your title MUST highlight what makes THIS specific product different from others.

IDENTIFY THE UNIQUE FEATURES:
- What is the SPECIFIC style/design? (vintage, modern, minimalist, bohemian, etc.)
- What is the EXACT color/pattern? (navy blue, floral, striped, geometric, etc.)
- What is the SPECIFIC material? (cotton, velvet, marble, wood, metal, etc.)
- What is the UNIQUE shape/form? (round, square, oversized, slim-fit, etc.)
- Who is the TARGET audience? (women's, men's, kids, unisex, etc.)
- What is the SPECIFIC use/function? (decorative, functional, outdoor, indoor, etc.)

TITLE STRUCTURE RULES:
1. START WITH THE MAIN KEYWORD: The product category/type that people search for MUST be prominent and logical
2. WRITE NATURALLY: Use proper grammar with prepositions - NOT just keyword stuffing!
   - French: Use "à", "en", "de", "avec" → "Sac à Bandoulière en Cuir Noir" NOT "Sac Bandoulière Cuir Noir"
   - English: Use "with", "in", "of" → "Bag with Leather Strap" or natural adjective order
   - Spanish: Use "de", "con", "en" → "Bolso de Cuero Negro"
   Write like a REAL product title that sounds natural, not robotic keyword stuffing!
3. LOGICAL WORD ORDER: Write like a NATURAL SENTENCE, not keyword stuffing!
   - Identify the MAIN PRODUCT CATEGORY (Hot Water Plush, Coffee Mug, Crossbody Bag, etc.)
   - Build a natural phrase around it with descriptive words BEFORE the category
   - English: Descriptive words + Main Category + Details
     ✓ "Cute Stitch Hot Water Plush" (natural sentence flow)
     ✓ "Vintage Floral Coffee Mug" (natural sentence flow)
     ✓ "Modern Black Leather Crossbody Bag" (natural sentence flow)
     NOT "Hot Water Bottle Cute Plush Bunny" (robotic keyword stuffing!)
   - French: Main product first with prepositions → "Bouillotte en Peluche Stitch Bleu" NOT "Stitch Peluche Bouillotte"
   - Spanish: Similar structure → "Taza de Cerámica Vintage Floral"
   Think: How would you NATURALLY describe this product in a sentence?
4. HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENTIATORS: Add what makes THIS product unique
5. BE PRECISE: Use exact colors, materials, styles - not generic terms
6. Maximum 55 characters
7. CRITICAL - Title Case capitalization: EVERY important word MUST start with a capital letter!
   - Capitalize ALL nouns, adjectives, verbs, colors, materials, styles
   - ONLY keep linking words lowercase: with, for, and, of, in, on, at, to, from, by, avec, en, de, pour, et, à, au, du, des, con, para, y, mit, von, für, und
   - Example CORRECT: "Doudou Lapin Rose Pâle à Robe Imprimée et Cils"
   - Example WRONG: "Doudou Lapin rose pâle à robe imprimée et cils" (missing capitals!)
8. NO generic titles - each product needs its own unique title

GOOD EXAMPLES (natural sentence flow):
English (descriptive words + main category, like speaking naturally):
✓ "Cute Stitch Hot Water Plush"
✓ "Vintage Floral Coffee Mug"
✓ "Modern Black Leather Crossbody Bag"
✓ "Minimalist White Ceramic Vase"
✓ "Bohemian Macrame Wall Hanging with Tassels"
✓ "Vintage Gold Filigree Drop Earrings"

French (product type first, natural grammar with prepositions, Title Case):
✓ "Bouillotte en Peluche Stitch Bleu"
✓ "Mug en Céramique Vintage Floral"
✓ "Vase en Porcelaine Blanc Minimaliste"
✓ "Sac à Bandoulière en Cuir Noir"
✓ "Boucles d'Oreilles en Or Vintage"
✓ "Doudou Lapin Rose Pâle à Robe Imprimée et Cils"

BAD EXAMPLES (robotic keyword stuffing, unnatural, or missing capitals):
✗ "Hot Water Bottle Cute Plush Bunny" (keyword stuffing - not natural!)
✗ "Coffee Mug Ceramic Vintage Floral" (keyword stuffing - not natural!)
✗ "Plush Cute Hot Water Bottle" (wrong order - not natural!)
✗ "Stitch Peluche Bouillotte Bleu" (character/brand first - WRONG for French!)
✗ "Sac Bandoulière Cuir Noir" (no prepositions - sounds robotic!)
✗ "Mug Céramique Floral" (missing "en" - unnatural!)
✗ "Doudou Lapin rose pâle à robe imprimée et cils" (missing capitals on important words!)
✗ "sac à bandoulière en cuir noir" (all lowercase - WRONG!)
✗ "Earrings" (no differentiators at all)

REMEMBER: Two similar products should have DIFFERENT titles based on their unique characteristics!
Example: 
- Product A: "Vintage Floral Ceramic Coffee Mug"
- Product B: "Modern Minimalist White Coffee Mug"
(Same product type, but different styles and features)

Think: "What makes THIS product different from similar products? How would I describe it to someone who can't see it?"

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION RULES (200-250 characters, 3-4 sentences):

1. Write NATURALLY and conversationally - like talking to a friend, not a marketing robot
2. VARY your structure - DON'T always start the same way (mix it up!)
3. NO capital letters for the product name - write it normally in the sentence
4. Be SPECIFIC about features you SEE in the image: exact colors, materials, visible details, design elements
5. BANNED WORDS: "elevate", "premium", "luxurious", "statement", "transform", "perfect", "ultimate", "revolutionary", "game-changer"
6. Keep sentences SHORT and punchy - no long complicated phrases
7. CRITICAL: Base description on VISUAL DETAILS you see in the image, not assumptions

VARY YOUR OPENING - DON'T start with the product name! Use different styles:
- Lead with benefit: "Stay warm and cozy with this..."
- Start with style/adjective: "Adorable and functional, this..."
- Target audience: "Perfect for coffee lovers, this..."
- Describe feeling/use: "Enjoy comfort on cold nights with..."
- Feature first: "Soft plush fabric and cute design make..."
- Context: "Whether at home or on the go, this..."

GOOD DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES (natural, varied, specific, ~200-250 chars):
✓ "Stay warm and cozy on chilly nights with this adorable plush hot water bottle. Features soft fabric with a cute Stitch character design. The removable cover is machine washable. Great for kids and adults alike."

✓ "Sip your morning coffee in style with this handcrafted ceramic mug. Delicate vintage floral pattern adds charm to your routine. Holds 12oz and is microwave and dishwasher safe. A lovely addition to any kitchen."

✓ "Make a bold impression with these eye-catching gold-tone grillz. Full pavé cubic zirconia stones deliver maximum sparkle. Comfortable one-size-fits-most design with adjustable fit. Easy to apply and remove for any occasion."

BAD DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES (avoid these!):
✗ "Elevate your urban style with our premium product, transforming your look into a luxurious statement piece..." (TOO FANCY, BANNED WORDS!)
✗ "Transform your look with this perfect accessory..." (BANNED WORDS, TOO VAGUE!)
✗ "The ultimate solution for your needs..." (GENERIC MARKETING SPEAK!)
